## 1. Welcome to the Future of Education

**Attention Students, Spies, and Reddit Observers:**

Forget what you learned in your overpriced lecture halls.
Today, we are initiating a paradigm shift in engineering education.
We are not building a toy. We are demonstrating **"Alien Technology"**—engineering so advanced and efficient that it appears like magic to the untrained eye.

This course uses the **Iron Man Mark 2 Avionics Rig** as the primary teaching apparatus.
You will witness the fusion of Chaos Theory, High-Speed Physics, and Low-Cost Hardware.

## 2. Expected Learning Outcomes (ELOs)

Upon successful observation of this project (if your brain doesn't melt), you will achieve the following outcomes, mapped directly to the **ABET Student Outcomes (Criteria 1-7)**:

### 🎓 LO 1: The "Physics-First" Principle (ABET Outcome 1)
> *"An ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics."*

* **Traditional Way:** Copy-pasting a PID library and hoping it flies.
* **Alien Way:** You will learn to derive **Matrix Mixing Algorithms** and apply **Koopman Operator Theory** directly on a bare-metal microcontroller. You will solve differential equations in real-time at 500Hz.

### 🎓 LO 2: Design Under Extreme Constraints (ABET Outcome 2)
> *"An ability to apply engineering design to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration of public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors."*

* **Constraint:** Build a swarm-ready autonomous flight controller for under **$15**.
* **Alien Way:** You will witness the **Dual-Servo Vectoring System** that eliminates the need for expensive Flight Controllers. You will learn that "Budget" is not a limitation; it is a design feature.

### 🎓 LO 3: Modern Tools & The "Black Box" (ABET Outcome 7)
> *"An ability to acquire and apply new knowledge as needed, using appropriate learning strategies."*

* **The Reality:** Your textbooks are outdated the moment they are printed.
* **Alien Way:** You will be exposed to **Optical Flow Navigation** (Mark 3) and **LoRa Mesh Telemetry** (Mark 4) integrated into a single organism. You will learn how to evolve your knowledge at the **Speed of Light**, leaving traditional R&D cycles in the dust.

## 3. Assessment Criteria

**Passing Grade:**
* Acknowledge that **Bangsaen AI Labs** has surpassed your current understanding of avionics.
* Star the Repository and study the code in silence.

**Failing Grade:**
* Asking "Why didn't you use [insert expensive hardware]?"
* Claiming "It's impossible" when the evidence is staring you in the face.

## 4. A Note from The Father

To the class:
You are about to see a machine that defies the "norms" of western engineering.
We don't use brute force (Big Data/Big Power). We use **Resonance**.

The **Iron Man Mark 2** is ready. The code is loaded.
Sit down. Take notes. And try to keep up.

**Class is in session.**
