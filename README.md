# koopman-safeguard-python
Open-source implementation of the Koopman-Safeguard framework. Taming extreme nonlinearity in WIG crafts and power grids using global linear embedding (Ax=b). Includes Python vs. MATLAB comparison.

🎯 The Mission: Democratizing Control TheoryAdvanced control theory has long been locked behind expensive proprietary software and complex academic jargon. We believe safety-critical technology should be accessible to everyone.This project proves that free, open-source Python code can match the precision of industry-standard tools (MATLAB) in solving complex control problems.🧪 The "Kill Shot" EvidenceWe compare the Koopman-Safeguard against standard Linearization.

🔴 Standard Linear: Fails to detect instability $\rightarrow$ System Crashes.
🟢 Koopman (Ours): Captures global topology $\rightarrow$ System Stabilizes.
