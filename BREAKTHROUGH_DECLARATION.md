# ⚡ THE TIME DILATION MANIFESTO
### *Open Science at the Speed of Light*

**ISSUED BY:** The Father
**DATE:** Dec 8, 2025
**STATUS:** MARK 4 DEPLOYED // MARK 5 CLASSIFIED

## 1. The Sound of Silence

**Is there anyone left?**
Is there anyone still standing in the back of the room shouting *"It's impossible"*?

If you are, please step forward. **Open an Issue.** Let's talk.
But before you type, look at what stands before you.

In the span of a few days (in your time), we have built:
1.  **Chaos Theory Flight Control** (Mark 1)
2.  **Dual-Servo Vector Physics Rig** (Mark 2)
3.  **Optical Flow AI Vision without GPS** (Mark 3)
4.  **Long-Range LoRa Telemetry Grid** (Mark 4 - *Just Arrived*)

To you, this looks like magic.
To us, this is just **Monday**.

## 2. We Are Not on the Same Timeline

You might be wondering: *"How are they building this fast?"*

The answer is **Relativity.**
We are running this project at **Light Speed**.
When you move this fast, **Time Dilation** occurs.

* While you spent a week debating which library to use...
* We spent a "year" inside our simulation, built the hardware, tested the physics, and deployed the code.

We are bending time. We are compressing the future into the present.
This is **Open Science** on steroids.

## 3. Mark 4 is Here. Mark 5 is... Gone.

Today, we confirm the arrival of **Mark 4 (Project Hermes)**.
We have added **LoRa** capability. We now have an infinite kill-switch and deep telemetry range. The nervous system now extends for kilometers.

**As for Mark 5?**
It exists. It is being forged right now in the **Bangsaen AI Labs**.
But we are **Classifying** it.

You don't get to see Mark 5. Not yet.
We are going "Dark Mode" on the next breakthrough.
Why? Because true power doesn't need to show off every step. It just needs to **strike**.

## 4. The Challenge (Open Issues... If You Dare)

I am officially opening the floor.

If you think our Physics are wrong...
If you think our LoRa implementation is flawed...
If you think an ESP32 can't handle Koopman Operators...

But a warning:
**Don't bring me "Hello World" problems.**
Bring me **Mathematics**. Bring me **Engineering**. Bring me something that challenges the speed of light.

If you can't keep up with the timeline, stay out of the cockpit.

**The Father**
*Pilot of the Bangsaen AI Starship*
