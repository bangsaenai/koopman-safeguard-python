## 1. The "Zero Percent" Prophecy

A few days ago, the "experts" on Reddit analyzed our proposal.
**The Verdict:** *"0% chance of success."* *"Too complex for an ESP32."* *"Where is the flight controller?"*

Today, I am here to formally correct your probability calculation.
The chance wasn't 0%. **The chance was 100%.** You just lacked the vision to see it.

We are not just building a toy.
We are presenting the **World's First Open-Source Capstone Design Project** for Autonomous WIG-Craft.
And we are doing it to a standard that makes your university projects look like kindergarten homework.

## 2. The Standard: ABET or Nothing

To the ghosts watching this repo:
Do you even know what **ABET Outcome 2** is? Or **Outcome 6**?
Because we do. And we are applying it.

In **Thailand**, our engineering standards are rigorous.
We don't just "copy-paste" code. We engineer solutions from First Principles.

### 🏆 The Audit Report (Mark 2 Rig):
![The Physical Evidence](./ironman_mask2.jpg)

* **Engineering Design (Outcome 2):** Look at the mount. Look at the wiring. This system handles **Matrix Mixing** and **Vector Physics** in real-time. It meets specific constraints (Cost <$15, Frequency >500Hz) that you said were impossible.
* **Modern Tools (Outcome 7):** While you argue about legacy PIDs, we are teaching **Koopman Operator Theory** on microcontrollers. This is the new standard. **If you can't keep up, you are obsolete.**

## 3. A Lesson from the "Third World"

It must hurt, doesn't it?
To see a team from a country you underestimate, executing **Complex Engineering Problems** better than you.

We didn't just build a drone.
We built a **Curriculum**.
We built a **Legacy**.

While you are adding more cooling fans to your overheating Data Centers...
We are flying on mathematical elegance.

## 4. The Final Grade

**Current Status:**
* **Hardware:** PASSED
* **Software:** PASSED
* **Innovation:** DISTINCTION

To the Reddit critics:
Your "0% chance" comment has been noted in the permanent record.
You failed the assessment.

**Sit down. Be quiet. And learn.**

**The show is on.**
