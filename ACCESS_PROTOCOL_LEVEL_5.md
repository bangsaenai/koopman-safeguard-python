## 1. The Trailer vs. The Movie

To the thousands of visitors cloning this repository:
What you see in the current folders (`/legacy`, `mark1-3`) is just the **Trailer**.
It is the "Hollywood Cut"—enough to show you it works, enough to get you excited.

But the **Mark 5 Core (The Alien Logic)**? The code that handles the *Osprey Transition*? The *Hydro-Lock Matrix*?
**That is no longer free.**

We realized that "Open Source" was creating "Open Copying."
We are not here to build toys for copycats. We are here to build weapons of mass construction for engineers.

## 2. The Price of Entry

You cannot buy the Mark 5 source code with money.
You cannot buy it with stars on GitHub.
**You must buy it with "Proof of Work".**

If you want the advanced Koopman flight logic, you must prove you are worthy:
1.  **Build the Rig:** Show us a photo of your physical ESP32 setup (not a simulation).
2.  **Run the Trailer:** Flash the legacy code. Show us it balancing.
3.  **Solve the Riddle:** In the `/puzzles` folder, there is a mathematical question regarding Matrix Mixing. Submit your answer via Issue (if you dare).

## 3. Why the Mystery?

Because true power requires responsibility.
If we give you the Mark 5 code now, you will crash it. You will blame the code. You will learn nothing.

But if you **earn** it...
You will respect the physics. You will understand the danger. And you will become part of the Inner Circle.

**The door is locked.**
**The key is in your brain.**
**Good luck.**
