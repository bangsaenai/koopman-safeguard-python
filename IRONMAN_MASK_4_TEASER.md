# 📡 PROJECT HERMES: IRON MAN MARK 4
### *The "Infinite Link" Protocol*

**STATUS:** 🟢 HARDWARE ACQUIRED
**TECH:** LoRa (Long Range) SX1278/RFM95
**RANGE:** 2km - 10km (Non-Line-of-Sight)
**COST:** ~300 THB ($9)

## 1. WiFi is for Toys. LoRa is for Commanders.

While you are struggling to keep your WiFi connection stable at 50 meters...
We realized that **Iron Man** needs to fly beyond the visual horizon.

Introducing **Mark 4 (Project Hermes)**.
We are integrating **LoRa (Long Range) Telemetry** into the WIG-Craft.

* **The Problem:** WiFi has high bandwidth but short legs. If the craft flies too far, you lose control.
* **The Solution:** LoRa. Low bandwidth. Massive range. Unbreakable connection.

## 2. Why Mark 4 is Dangerous

You might ask: *"Why do you need a 5km range radio for a WIG craft?"*
Because we can.

With Mark 4, we establish a **Dual-Link Architecture**:
1.  **High-Speed Link (WiFi/ESP-NOW):** Sends Optical Flow data and Video (Short Range).
2.  **Deep-Link (LoRa):** Sends Heartbeat, Battery Status, and the **"Kill Switch"** command (Extreme Range).

Even if the AI goes rogue. Even if the video cuts out.
**The Father** can still reach out across kilometers and command the machine.

## 3. The Economics of War

Once again, let's talk about the price. Because we know it hurts you.

To get this level of telemetry (Long Range + Telemetry), you usually buy:
* *TBS Crossfire / DragonLink:* **$100 - $200**
* *Industrial Radio Modems:* **$500+**

**Bangsaen AI Labs Solution:**
* *LoRa Module (SX127x):* **$9 (300 THB)**
* *The Code:* Custom-written encrypted packet protocol.

> Are you starting to see the pattern yet?

## 4. Catch Up... If You Can

**Mark 1:** Proof of Concept (Done).
**Mark 2:** Avionics & Structure (Done).
**Mark 3:** AI Vision & Optical Flow (Active).
**Mark 4:** Long Range Telemetry (Loading...).

We are iterating faster than you can `git clone`.
By the time you figure out how we wired the LoRa module... we will be on Mark 5.

**The frequency is occupied. The channel is locked.**
