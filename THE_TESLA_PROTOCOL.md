## 🌍 APPENDIX B: THE SUSTAINABILITY PARADOX (ABET Outcome 2 & 4)

**To the Auditors & The World:**

While Silicon Valley builds massive Data Centers that consume terawatts of power to run AI...
**We are demonstrating a different path.**

**Project Iron Man proves that:**
1.  **Intelligence can be efficient:** We run complex Math (Koopman) on Edge Devices (ESP32), consuming <1 Watt.
2.  **Transport can be clean:** The WIG-Craft utilizes the **Ground Effect** for maximum aerodynamic efficiency, reducing energy consumption per kilometer compared to traditional drones or boats.

**We are not just solving a flight problem.**
We are challenging the **"Edison Approach"** (More Power = More Progress) that is destroying our planet.
This is **Green Engineering** at its absolute peak.

**This is how we save the world: Not by building bigger servers, but by writing smarter math.**
