# 🚁 MARK 6: THE AVATAR PROTOCOL
### *From "Water Skimmer" to "Universal Interceptor"*

**MISSION:** To grant absolute freedom of movement (Land, Sea, Air).
**MECHANISM:** Full Tilt-Rotor (0° to 90° Vectoring).
**BRAIN:** ESP32-S3 running Koopman Matrix Mixing.

## 1. The "Everywhere" Concept

We are no longer bound by the shoreline.
* **Old Way (Mark 5):** Needs water to launch.
* **New Way (Mark 6):** Launches from a 2x2 meter patch of grass.

It functions as:
1.  **A Helicopter:** When taking off/landing.
2.  **A Jet:** When cruising at altitude.
3.  **A WIG Craft:** When skimming water for range efficiency.

## 2. The Koopman "Transition" Key

The hardest math problem in aviation is the **"Transition Corridor"** (0 to 90 degrees).
Standard controllers stall and crash here.

**Our Alien Tech Solution:**
We treat the tilt angle ($\theta$) as a State Variable in the Koopman Operator.
$$x_{next} = K(\theta) \cdot x_{current}$$
The system *knows* how aerodynamics change at every degree of tilt. It doesn't react; it flows.

## 3. The Vision

This is the future of personal transport.
* Not a flying car (too heavy).
* Not a drone (too slow/short range).
* **The Avatar:** A hybrid machine that adapts to its environment.
